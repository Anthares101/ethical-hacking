# Utility scripts

## What is this?

Basically, the idea of this repository is to just group all those scripts I write to automate or do stuff that could be interesting in the future for something else.

## Documentation?

Every script will have a little comment on top with some information about it but don't expect a great documentation, these are mostly dirty scripts that just do the work for me. I wanted to share them since maybe someone find some of them useful.
