# Ethical Hacking

## What is this?

Basically, the idea of this repository is to just group all those scripts, PoC, exploits... I write that could be interesting in the future for something else.

## Documentation?

Everything will have a little comment on top with some information about it but don't expect a great documentation, these are mostly dirty scripts that just do the work for me. I wanted to share them since maybe someone find some of them useful.
